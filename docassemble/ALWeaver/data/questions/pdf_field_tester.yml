event: empty_pdf
question: You uploaded an empty PDF
subquestion: |
  The PDF you uploaded (${ template_upload[0].filename }) does not have any 
  fillable fields. To make a new interview with the Weaver, we need to have a 
  document that has fillable fields.
  
  If you saved a DOCX file as a PDF, you will need to add fillable fields in a 
  tool like [Adobe Acrobat](https://acrobat.adobe.com). 
  For more info, see the [documentation](https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/pdfs).

  If you uploaded a form that can only be opened in Adobe Acrobat (a LiveCycle
  or XFA form), you may need to flatten it first. You can flatten an XFA form
  using [iText PDF's free 
  tool](https://itextpdf.com/en/demos/flatten-dynamic-xfa-pdf-free-online).

subquestion: |
  There are fields that can't be turned into descriptive variable names in the given PDF. You should make sure all field names abide by the rules in the [documentation](https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/pdfs).

subquestion: |
  The table below shows all of the fields present in your PDF. Read through 
  it to make sure that everything is as you expect it to be.      
  
  A **bold** name means that this field is **reserved**, because input for this 
  field will be asked by a built-in question from the AL Question Library later 
  in your playground. Common reserved-field examples are: fields associated 
  with signature or representing someone's name. If you expect a field to be 
  bold but it isn't, check the field's spelling.

  Name (bold if {reserved}) | Type | {Internal DA name} | Max length
  -----------|------------|-------------------|-----------
  % for field in all_fields:
  ${":exclamation-triangle: " if ' ' in field[0] else ''} ${":exclamation-circle: " if len(remove_multiple_appearance_indicator(varname(field[0]))) == 0 else ''} ${'**' + str(field[0]) + '**' if is_reserved_label(field[0]) or field[0] in possible_custom else field[0]} ${ ':question:' if field[0] in possible_custom else ''} | ${ pdf_field_type_str(field) } (${field[4]}) | ${map_raw_to_final_display(field[0]) if not (map_raw_to_final_display(field[0]) == field[0]) else ''} | ${ get_character_limit(field) if get_character_limit(field) else 'n/a' }

  % if len(signature_fields_test) > 0:
  The following are signature fields: 
  
  % for sig in signature_fields_test:

  The following are checkbox fields: 
  
  % for chk in checkbox_fields:
  * ${ chk }
  % endfor
  % endif
  
  % if 'space' in warnings:
  :exclamation-triangle: Indicates that the field name has a space in it.
  Replace any spaces with underscores in the PDF field name before continuing.
  % endif
  
  % if 'not handled' in warnings:
  :skull-crossbones: Indicates it's a field type that our interview generator
  does not currently handle. 
  If you can, make the field into a checkbox, text input, 
  or digital signature field.
  % endif
  
  % if len(possible_custom) > 0:
  :question: Indicates that we think this field could be handled by 
  questions in our question library, so you don't have to write your own questions for it! You can choose whether to use our default questions later.
