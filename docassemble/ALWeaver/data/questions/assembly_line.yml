  ##### &#11093; What the Weaver does
  
  1. Creates a draft Docassemble interview, as a package you can install and
     continue customizing. The interview is supported at runtime by other [_**Assembly
     Line**_ 
     tools](https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/).
  1. Builds all of the standard interview elements for you, including
     introduction, preview, download, and user instructions, with standardized
     variable names.
  1. Catches common errors with PDF forms.
  </div>
  <div class="panel_yellow" markdown="1">
  ##### &#11093; What you need to do
  
  1. Start with the template first. Add [standardized 
     labels](https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/label_variables)
     to take advantage of built-in questions.
  1. Upload your template and answer all the questions on the screens.
     Smart defaults save you time along the way.
  2. Download your completed interview. It should run out of the box as a rough prototype.
  </div>

    Court Forms Online project.
    
    New jurisdictions will be added soon. You should add those dependencies

id: action-oriented splash title
question: |
  Add your form name to the branding page
subquestion: |
  Every interview starts with a "brand" page with a terms of use.
  Add your form's purpose to this page so your user knows they are in
  the right place. Usually, the best way to do this is using 
  action-oriented text to call the user to action. 
  
  Example: "Ask the court for a restraining order" or "Demand your landlord 
  return your security deposit".
  
  Or start with words like "File a...", "Write a...", "Get a..." depending on 
  your form type, followed by your form name.
  
  This is what it looks like:
  
  [FILE branding_extra, 80%]
  
  **Remember:** You can always change this text later in your playground.
fields:
  - Action-oriented text: interview_intro_prompt
    default: ${ interview_intro_prompt_default }

---
id: form-specific intro page
question: |
  Form description and "Getting Started" page
subquestion: |
  Use plain language that will be understandable to 
  someone who uses this form without a lawyer.
  
  Do your best to tell your user what they need to know before they
  get started on the form. For example, you may want to tell them about:
  
  1. How much time the form will take to complete.  
  1. Documents to have at hand.
  1. Information they may need to ask someone else for or to look up.
  1. Steps they will need to take before they can deliver the form, 
    such as printing or getting a notary.
  
  **Remember:** you can change the text later in your playground. Start with
  a rough draft.
fields:
  - Title: interview.title
    default: ${ short_filename_with_spaces }
  - Short title that will show up on small screens: interview.short_title
    default: ${ short_filename_with_spaces }
  - Short description of your form: interview.description
    default: ${ short_filename_with_spaces }
    datatype: area
    rows: 2
  - label: |
      "Getting started" page
    field: interview.getting_started
    default: ${ short_filename_with_spaces }
    datatype: area
    help: |
      Tell your user what they need to know before they start the form.
      This helps your user feel prepared and
      prevents frustration later in your interview, especially for longer
      forms. You can use Markdown lists (1. ) and bullets (*) at the beginning
      of a line to add formatting.

id: information about people
question: |
  User's role for your form
subquestion: |  
  Knowing user's role and "people variables" in general will help the Weaver 
  to handle those fields accordingly.
fields:
  - note: |
      The list of names below look like names for people, based on
      how you use them in your document.
    show if:
      code: |
        len(get_person_variables(all_fields, custom_only=True)) > 0
  - Which variable names represent people?: people_variables
    datatype: checkboxes
    code: |
      get_person_variables(all_fields, custom_only=True)
    help: |
      "person" variables will get things like addresses, multi-part
      names, and proper questions handled automatically. Using them
      will help you save time writing your interview.
  - note: |
      For this ${interview.title} form, is the user of the form typically the 
      Plaintiff/Petitioner or the Defendant/Respondent?

      - The Plaintiff/Petitioner starts a case. 
      - The Defendant/Respondent responds to a case someone else started.
  - User's role: interview.typical_role
    input type: radio
    choices:
      - Plaintiff/Petitioner: plaintiff
      - Defendant/Respondent: defendant
      - Could be either: unknown
      - None of the above: na
    help: |
      If form type is an appeal, this is asking about the role in the trial court, not appellate proceeding.
  #- Number of users whose information can be filled in on this form: user_count
  #  choices:
  #    - One user of this form at a time: one
  #    - More than one user can sign and file this form at once: multiple
      
help: |
  For example, if you are starting a new case, you are always the plaintiff
  or petitioner. 
  
  If you are a tenant responding to an eviction case, you are usually the
  Defendant.
  
  If you are responding to an existing case that is not an eviction, you
  might be the defendant, but in some cases you could be the plaintiff.
  
  If you are not sure: please review the form and talk to a subject matter 
  expert. This can always be fixed later.

  Quantify "people variables" on your form

  % if added_other_party:
  **Note**: Your form includes `defendants/respondents` or
  `plaintiffs/petitioners`. In the interview file, those variables will be
  replaced with `users` and `other_parties` depending on the role the user of
  the form has in the case.
  % endif
  
  The Weaver needs to know how many people each variable can represent.
fields:
  - code: people_quantity_question
help:
  label: |
    What is this about?
  content: |
    By default, all "person" variables are plural.
    
    If you only want one of each person type to ever use this form,
    tell us here. You'll still be able to edit your file if you change
    your mind later.

question: |
  Create on-screen labels for your fields
subquestion: |  
  Fields in your form will become input variables on the question-screens of your interview. As those field labels can be too technical for your user to understand when displayed on the screen, before you start building the question-screens, here you get to make them more user-friendly.
  
  % if len(field_question) > 0:
  1. Look at each field below. It represents a blank space on your template.
  1. If the field is handled as a "basic question", it will not be shown
  below. Instead, we will use a pre-written label for it.
  2. Assign each field an on-screen label. The label is shown to the user
  of your form. We start with the name of the field as a label. Edit it so it makes sense.
  2. Double-check the kind of input your field uses, as well as the type
  of data it will hold.
    
  * `yesno` is for true/false checkboxes
  * `text` is a normal text field. `area` is a text field with more room (3 lines by default)
  * `integer` is a whole number, while `number` can have a decimal point. `currency` represents a dollar figure
  * `date` is a standard date picker, which shows a calendar in most browsers.
