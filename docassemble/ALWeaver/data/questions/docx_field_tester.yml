id: Did you intend to use Mako syntax
question: |
  Did you intend to use Mako syntax?
subquestion: |
  Your DOCX template looks like it is using the Mako syntax ${ }. Usually
  this is an error. DOCX files use Jinja2 syntax, not Mako. You may want to 
  stop here and fix your template by replacing any instances of <%text>`${ }` 
  with `{{ }}`.</%text>
  
  These are the lines that look like they contain Mako syntax:
  
  % for match in mako_matches:
  * ${ match }
  % endfor
  
  If the matches above are "false positives" or you intentionally used
  Mako syntax in your DOCX file, keep on going, but your template
  might not do what you intended. 
  
  Check out the documentation for 
  [python-docx-template](https://docxtpl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#jinja2-like-syntax) 
  and for [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) to learn more.

  #### Fields
  
  All of the fields in your DOCX file are listed in the table below.
  Confirm that the table looks right.
  
  A **bold** name means that this field is **reserved**.
  Reserved fields are fields that will be handled with a question that
  comes from the AL Question Library. For example:
  
  * Name fields
  * Address fields
  * Basic contact information and court information
  
  If you expect a field to be bold but it isn't, check the field's spelling.

  The **type** of each field is just a guess, based on the field's name.
  You can override the guess later.

  Name (bold if {reserved}) | Type
  --------------------------|------
  % for field in docx_validation_fields:
  ${ bold(field.variable) if field.reserved else field.variable} |  ${ field.field_type_guess }| 
  % endfor
  % for field in docx_custom_people:
  ${ bold(field.variable) } :question: | ${ field.field_type_guess }
  % endfor
  
  % if len(docx_custom_people) > 0:
  :question: Indicates that we think this field could be handled by 
  questions in our question library, so you don't have to write your own 
  questions for it! You can choose whether to use our default questions later.
  % endif
  
  #### Preview  
  Look over the PDF preview of your file below. Make sure that the
  fonts, spacing, and styles look about right. Note: the conditional logic
  and text your user enters can change the formatting. You will also
  see the placeholder variable names unchanged in this preview.
  
  For safety, we recommend that you use the standard [Microsoft Core Fonts
  for the Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web), including
  Arial and Times New Roman, as the standard fonts in Word templates.
  
  If spacing or other formatting looks wrong, try editing your file in
  [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) and get it looking right
  there.
