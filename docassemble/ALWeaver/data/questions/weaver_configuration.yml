  Configure Weaver
subquestion: |
  The Weaver looks for packages on this server that have said they contain the ability
  to add customizations, such as new dependencies, variable names, or output patterns.
  You can add your own Docassemble package that has custom options. For an example
  package, view [ALAnyState](https://github.com/suffolklitlab/docassemble-alanystate).

  Published Weaver capabilities:
  
  % for capability in weaverdata.get("published_configuration_capabilities"):
  % if "playground" not in capability:
  * ${ capability }
  % else:
  * ${ capability } _(playground only)_
  % endif
  % endfor
  
  You can clear the configuration by erasing the list of published capabilities. Restarting the
  server will re-publish capabilities for any packages that are currently on this server.
