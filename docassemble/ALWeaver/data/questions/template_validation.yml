id: confirm-mixed-document-fields
continue button field: validate_mixed_documents
question: |
  Validate your templates
subquestion: |
  #### Your upload contains both DOCX and PDF files

  #### Fields
  
  All of the fields in your template files are listed in the table below.
  Confirm that the table looks right.
  
  A **bold** name means that this field is **reserved**.
  Reserved fields are fields that will be handled with a question that
  comes from the AL Question Library. For example:
  
  * Name fields
  * Address fields
  * Basic contact information and court information
  
  If you expect a field to be bold but it isn't, check the field's spelling.

  The **type** of each field is just a guess, based on the field's name.
  You can override the guess later.

  Name (bold if {reserved}) | Type
  --------------------------|------
  % for field in validation_fields.builtins():
  ${ bold(field.variable) } :question: | ${ field.field_type_guess } |
  % endfor
  % for field in validation_fields.custom():
  ${ bold(field.variable) if field.reserved else field.variable } |  ${ field.field_type_guess } | 
  % endfor
  % for field in validation_fields.signatures():
  ${ bold(field.variable) if field.reserved else field.variable } | signature  |
  % endfor
    
  #### Preview  
  Look over the PDF preview of your file below. Make sure that the
  fonts, spacing, and styles look about right. Note: the conditional logic
  and text your user enters can change the formatting. You will also
  see the placeholder variable names unchanged in this preview.
  
  For safety, we recommend that you use the standard [Microsoft Core Fonts
  for the Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web), including
  Arial and Times New Roman, as the standard fonts in Word templates.
  
  If spacing or other formatting looks wrong, try editing your file in
  [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) and get it looking right
  there.

question: |
  You do not have any labels that match the Assembly Line labels
subquestion: |
  It is a good idea to use labels that match the Assembly Line documentation.
  Almost every form has a user and most forms also have an opposing party.
  You should use the Assembly Line labels for these concepts.
  
  You can also add labels for:
  
  * names for different kinds of people
  * signatures
  * addresses
  * court information

question: You uploaded an empty PDF
subquestion: |
  The PDF you uploaded (${ interview.uploaded_templates[0].filename }) does not have any 
  fillable fields. To make a new interview with the Weaver, we need to have a 
  document that has fillable fields.
  
  If you saved a DOCX file as a PDF, you will need to add fillable fields in a 
  tool like [Adobe Acrobat](https://acrobat.adobe.com). 
  For more info, see the [documentation](https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/pdfs).

  If you uploaded a form that can only be opened in Adobe Acrobat (a LiveCycle
  or XFA form), you may need to flatten it first. You can flatten an XFA form
  using [iText PDF's free 
  tool](https://itextpdf.com/en/demos/flatten-dynamic-xfa-pdf-free-online).

id: Did you intend to use Mako syntax
question: |
  Did you intend to use Mako syntax?
subquestion: |
  Your DOCX template looks like it is using the Mako syntax ${ }. Usually
  this is an error. DOCX files use Jinja2 syntax, not Mako. You may want to 
  stop here and fix your template by replacing any instances of <%text>`${ }` 
  with `{{ }}`.</%text>
  
  These are the lines that look like they contain Mako syntax:

  If the matches above are "false positives" or you intentionally used
  Mako syntax in your DOCX file, keep on going, but your template
  might not do what you intended. 
  
  Check out the documentation for 
  [python-docx-template](https://docxtpl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#jinja2-like-syntax)

  It will get the value or use the meaning that it normally has in Docassemble.

  Check out [the labeling

  #### Preview  
  Look over the PDF preview of your file below. Make sure that the fonts,
  spacing, and styles look about right. Note: the conditional logic and text
  your user enters can change the formatting by moving text to a new line. You
  will also see the placeholder variable names unchanged in this preview.
  
  In DOCX templates, for safety, we recommend that you use the standard
  [Microsoft Core Fonts for the
  Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web), including Arial
  and Times New Roman, as the standard fonts. It is possible to install additional
  fonts but it may be complex.
  
  If spacing or other formatting looks wrong, try editing your DOCX files in
  [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) and get it looking right there.
