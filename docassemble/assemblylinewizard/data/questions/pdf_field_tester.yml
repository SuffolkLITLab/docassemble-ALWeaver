  The following are signature fields: ${comma_and_list(signature_fields)} 
  
  The following are checkbox fields: ${comma_and_list(checkbox_fields)}
  
  **Bold**/reserved names means that we wrote and translated a question for this
  field that will be used as a default in every interview. If you expect it
  to be bold, check spelling.
  
  Names for groups of **people** should be bold if you followed our naming guidelines.
  Please make sure that you used the right name. E.g., use "plaintiff" not
  "plaintiff_tenant". Check for misspellings if a name is not bold.
  
  Let us know if we should add a new type of person.
  
  % if 'space' in warnings:
  :exclamation-triangle: Indicates that the field name has a space in it. Please
  replace any spaces with underscores in the PDF field name before uploading to 
  Trello.
  % endif
  
  % if 'not handled' in warnings:
  :skull-crossbones: Indicates it's a field type that our interview generator
  does not currently handle. OR that the field has a duplicate name. 
  Please make sure the field is a checkbox, text 
  input, or digital signature field and that it is not a duplicate.
  % endif
  
  The internal Docassemble field name may be different from the name in the PDF
  even if it is not a "reserved" name. This check is mostly to help interview
  authors, not quality control.

terms: 
  - reserved: |
      Means there is a built-in question for this field.
  - Internal docassemble name: |
      Means that the variable name will be changed for Docassemble. 
      We change names that have built-in questions, as well as those starting
      with the name of a person/group of people, which we turn into "attributes" of that person.

  Here is the filled-in PDF
subquestion: |
  The fields are filled in with the name that we'll use in the YAML file.
  
  All checkboxes should be checked. If not, please check the field's
  "export" value. It should be set to "Yes".
  
  If the text is unusually sized, then please check the font size and 
  whether the field is set to allow multiple lines.
  
  All signature fields should be filled in with this image: ${placeholder_signature}
