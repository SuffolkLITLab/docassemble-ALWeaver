question: |
  Information about people on this form
subquestion: |  
  For this ${interview.title} form, is the user of the form typically the 
  Plaintiff/Petitioner or the Defendant/Respondent?

  The Plaintiff/Petitioner starts a case. The Defendant/Respondent
  is responding to a case someone else started.
fields:
  - User's role: interview.typical_role
    input type: radio
    choices:
      - Plaintiff/Petitioner: plaintiff
      - Defendant/Respondent: defendant
      - Could be either: unknown
  - Number of users whose information can be filled in on this form: user_count
    choices:
      - One user of this form at a time: one
      - More than one user can sign and file this form at once: multiple
      
help: |
  For example, if you are starting a new case, you are always the plaintiff
  or petitioner. 
  
  If you are a tenant responding to an eviction case, you are usually the
  Defendant.
  
  If you are responding to an existing case that is not an eviction, you
  might be the defendant, but in some cases you could be the plaintiff.
  
  If you are not sure: please review the form and talk to a subject matter 
  expert. We can always fix this later.

  On-screen prompts
subquestion: |  

  1. Look at each field below. It represents a blank space on your template.
  1. If the field is handled as a "basic question", it will not be shown
  below. Instead, we will use a pre-written prompt for it.
  2. Assign each field an on-screen prompt. The prompt is shown to the user
  of your form. We start with the name of the field as a prompt. Edit it so it makes sense.
  2. Double-check the kind of input your field uses, as well as the type
  of data it will hold.
    
  * `yesno` is for true/false checkboxes
  * `text` is a normal text field. `area` is a text field with more room (3 lines by default)
  * `integer` is a whole number, while `number` can have a decimal point. `currency` represents a dollar figure
  * `date` is a standard date picker, which shows a calendar in most browsers.
