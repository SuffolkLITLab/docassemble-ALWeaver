question: |
  Interview roles
subquestion: |  
  For this ${interview.title} form, is the user of the form typically the 
  Plaintiff/Petitioner or the Defendant/Respondent?

  The Plaintiff/Petitioner starts a case. The Defendant/Respondent
  is responding to a case someone else started.
fields:
  - no label: interview.typical_role
    input type: radio
    choices:
      - Plaintiff/Petitioner: plaintiff
      - Defendant/Respondent: defendant
      - Could be either: unknown
help: |
  For example, if you are starting a new case, you are always the plaintiff
  or petitioner. 
  
  If you are a tenant responding to an eviction case, you are usually the
  Defendant.
  
  If you are responding to an existing case that is not an eviction, you
  might be the defendant, but in some cases you could be the plaintiff.
  
  If you are not sure: please review the form and talk to a subject matter 
  expert. We can always fix this later.

  Label the fields
subquestion: |
  Below is a list of the field names in this PDF.
  
  We left out the fields that are included in our basic interview already.
  
  For each field, please enter in a descriptive label (this shows to the user),
  as well as selecting the type of information the field will hold.
  
  * `yesno` is a checkbox
  * `text` is a normal text field. `area` is a text field with more room (3 lines by default)
  * `integer` is a whole number, while `number` can have a decimal point. `currency` represents a dollar figure
  
  We have tried to guess the type of field from the name of the variable.
