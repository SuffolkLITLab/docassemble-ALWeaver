  Action title
subquestion: |
  Your interview will include a branded splash page. This screen
  has a place to mention the name of the form. Usually, the best way
  to do this is in the form of an action.
  
  Example: "Ask the court for a restraining order" or "Demand your landlord
  return your security deposit".

  What action title do you want?

  - Action title: interview_intro_prompt

id: form-specific intro page
question: |
  Your specific form's intro screen
subquestion: |
  Give the people using your form a little context. Use plain language that will be understandable to someone who uses this form without a lawyer. Tell them what they need to know about this specific form before they move forward.
  
  Remember, you can change it later.
fields:
  - Title: interview.title
    default: ${ short_filename_with_spaces }

id: information about people
question: |
  Information about people on this form
subquestion: |  
  For this ${interview.title} form, is the user of the form typically the 
  Plaintiff/Petitioner or the Defendant/Respondent?

  The Plaintiff/Petitioner starts a case. The Defendant/Respondent
  is responding to a case someone else started.
fields:
  - note: |
      The list of names below look like names for people, based on
      how you use them in your document.

      "person" variables will get things like addresses, multi-part
      names, and proper questions handled automatically. Using them
      will help you save time writing your interview.
  - User's role: interview.typical_role
    input type: radio
    choices:
      - Plaintiff/Petitioner: plaintiff
      - Defendant/Respondent: defendant
      - Could be either: unknown
  #- Number of users whose information can be filled in on this form: user_count
  #  choices:
  #    - One user of this form at a time: one
  #    - More than one user can sign and file this form at once: multiple
      
help: |
  For example, if you are starting a new case, you are always the plaintiff
  or petitioner. 
  
  If you are a tenant responding to an eviction case, you are usually the
  Defendant.
  
  If you are responding to an existing case that is not an eviction, you
  might be the defendant, but in some cases you could be the plaintiff.
  
  If you are not sure: please review the form and talk to a subject matter 
  expert. This can always be fixed later.

question: You uploaded an empty PDF
subquestion: |
  The PDF you uploaded (${ template_upload[0].filename }) does not have any fillable fields.
  To make a new interview, we need to have a document that has fillable fields.
  
  If you saved a DOCX file as a PDF, you will need to add fillable fields in a tool like [Adobe Acrobat](https://acrobat.adobe.com). 
  For more info, see the [documentation](https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/pdfs).

  2. Assign each field an on-screen prompt. The prompt is shown to the user
  of your form. We start with the name of the field as a prompt. Edit it so it makes sense.
  2. Double-check the kind of input your field uses, as well as the type
  of data it will hold.
    
  * `yesno` is for true/false checkboxes
  * `text` is a normal text field. `area` is a text field with more room (3 lines by default)
  * `integer` is a whole number, while `number` can have a decimal point. `currency` represents a dollar figure
  * `date` is a standard date picker, which shows a calendar in most browsers.
