The Assembly Line Project is a collection of volunteers, students, and institutions who joined together
during the COVID-19 pandemic to help increase access to the court system. Our vision is mobile-friendly,
easy to use **guided** online forms that help empower litigants to access the court remotely.

Our signature project is [CourtFormsOnline.org](https://courtformsonline.org).

We designed a step-by-step, assembly line style process for automating court forms on top of Docassemble
and built several tools along the way that **you** can use in your home jurisdiction.

This package contains an **automation and rapid prototyping tool** to support authoring robust,
consistent, and attractive Docassemble interviews that help complete court forms. Upload a labeled
PDF or DOCX file, and the Assembly Line Weaver will produce a runnable, clean code, draft of a
Docassemble interview that you can continue to edit and refine.
